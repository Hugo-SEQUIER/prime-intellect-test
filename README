The attached image provides a detailed overview of our testing metrics across different GPU models. For each GPU configuration, you can observe key parameters such as CPU, memory specifications, disk size, VRAM, and performance metrics such as time, RAM usage, accuracy, and cost associated with running specific deep learning models like Nvidia Minitron 8B, Mistral v0.3 (7B), Llama 3.1 (8B), and Gemma 2 (9B). This data is crucial for evaluating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of deploying models on different GPU setups provided by PrimeIntellect.

## Setting Up Your Test Environment

Once you've connected to a VM, setting up and running the test scripts is straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open your VM's terminal.
   - Execute the following command to clone the repository containing the test scripts:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Hugo-SEQUIER/prime-intellect-test.git
     ```

2. **Prepare the Scripts**
   - Ensure that all scripts in the cloned repository are executable by running:
     ```bash
     find prime-intellect-test -type f -name "*.sh" -exec chmod +x {} \;
     ```

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can leverage PrimeIntellect's VMs to perform comprehensive benchmarks on different GPUs using our pre-configured PyTorch images. This will aid in making informed decisions about which GPU configuration best suits your deep learning tasks in terms of performance and cost efficiency.
